## spex

Spatial extent with projection metadata. 

Create a fully-fledged SpatialPolygonsDataFrame *extent* from any object understood
by the 'raster' package function 'extent()'. If the input has projection metadata it
will be carried through to the output. 

There is also a method to put an extent and a crs together. 

## Examples

```{r}
library(spex)
library(raster)
data(lux)
(exlux <- spex(lux))

plot(lux)
plot(exlux, add = TRUE)
title(projection(exlux), cex.main = 0.7)
## put an extent and a CRS together
spex(extent(0, 1, 0, 1), crs = "+proj=laea +ellps=WGS84")
```
